# Eric Johnson: About Me

I am a passionate educator and researcher, currently living in Minneapolis, Minnesota with my longtime partner and two cats.

I work as a postdoctoral researcher for the [Mani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=81qY5lEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Pincus](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Jg6FmzsAAAAJ) groups at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, where I study the ways in which we analyze high-dimensional data in biology. Specifically, I'm looking at how we can best understand single-cell sequencing data from Yeast. More generally, I like to think about what modern data sets *look like* and how we can choose or adapt modern techniques to analyze these data.

## Professional Background

This website serves as a landing page that will connect my various projects and interests.

For those who might be interested in my professional background, my [C.V.](./Curriculum-Vitae.md), [teaching statement](./TeachingStatement.md), [list of publications](./Publications.md), and other materials can be found linked to the left.

## [What Do Your Data Say?](https://ejohnson643.github.io/WhatDoYourDataSay/)

*What Do Your Data Say?* is a course that I have co-developed with Professor Mani over the past several years in order to teach students how to think quantitatively about data, especially in biological contexts.  As a result of this work, we have developed a set of course notes and materials that can be used to teach this one-term course.  This course has been successfully taught to high-level undergraduates and graduate students several times and has also been adapted into a [4-week bootcamp](https://www.whatdoyourdatasay.com/) that we taught to hundreds of students in April 2020.  These resources can be found at my [WDYDS repository](https://ejohnson643.github.io/WhatDoYourDataSay/).

## [Python Tutorial](https://ejohnson643.github.io/PythonTutorial/)

In order to prepare students for quantitative thinking about data, it is sometimes necessary to bring them up to speed on basic programming. [This tutorial](https://ejohnson643.github.io/PythonTutorial/) was developed to bring students from little or no programming experience to the level of exposure needed to participate in the *What Do Your Data Say?* class.

## [EMBEDR]((https://ejohnson643.github.io/EMBEDR/)

[*Empirical Marginal resampling Better Embeds Dimensionality Reduction*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510181/) is a method I developed during my Ph.D. to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) methods are actually preserving high-dimensional structures in their embeddings.  This work was also presented in my thesis and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/ejohnson643/EMBEDR).

Here is Eric adding information.  This is me, Eric!

Ok just checking that I know how this works. -->
