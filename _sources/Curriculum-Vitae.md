## Research Projects and Interests

### **EMBEDR**: A Statistical Approach to Dimensionality Reduction

Applying a statistical approach to quality assessment of dimensionality reduction algorithms (DRAs) reveals novel, biologically-relevant structures in scRNA-seq data sets. The approach summarizes embedding quality as p-values allowing for rigorous interpretation of DRA output. Initial findings published in [Patterns](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100443).

### A Principled Approach to scRNA-seq Analysis

A plethora of methods for normalizing, imputing, sorting, and slicing scRNA-seq data have been proposed over the last decade, but there is little consensus around which methods work well. Working with the Mani and Pincus groups and data from a unique set of experiments, we’re spending the time to assess the extent to which we can apply and make use of various compuational techniques for extracting information from these data sets.

### Bayesian Circular-Linear Regression with Regularization

Developing a novel regression technique for modeling circular response variables on linear covariates using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Applications include predicting the time at which biological samples were drawn in order to create technologies capable of diagnosing circadian disorders. Initial findings presented in [Ph.D. thesis](https://doi.org/10.21985/n2-wase-dd15).

### Fitting Models of *Drosophila* Clock Neurons using Multi-Objective Optimization

Using electrophysiology and RNA-sequencing of DN1 and LNv ”clock” neurons in Drosophila to fit models at different circadian times with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Data analysis, computer science, and advanced electrophysiological measurements are used to deduce models’ structure and parameters. A novel feature extraction algorithm arising from this work was [presented at Neuroscience 2019](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/7883/presentation/49645).
