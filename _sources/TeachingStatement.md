# Teaching

As a lifelong learner, I've always appreciated the value of a good teacher, and as I've progressed through my academic career, I am now excited to be able to try to be a good teacher for new students. On this page, I will detail my teaching philosophy, as well as provide a brief history of the various teaching experiences I have had. The most important such experience has been teaching "[*What Do Your Data Say?*](https://ejohnson643.github.io/WhatDoYourDataSay)" which has its own page that I will link to throughout.
